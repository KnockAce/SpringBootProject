## Introduction

Here is a brief introduction to the project.

## Getting Started
# Requirements

- Java 17
- Maven 3.8.1
- Docker 20.10.8
- Docker Compose 1.29.2
- Spring Boot 2.7.5

If it's not possible to install the above requirements, you can use your own MySQL database and change the `application.properties` file.

- MySQL 5.7

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account and then clone it to your local device
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. If you want to use your own MySQL database, change the `application.properties` file
4. Here is an example of the `application.properties` file:

Do not forget to change the `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password` properties.

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/rioc
spring.datasource.username = root
spring.datasource.password = root
```
5. If not run the following command to start the MySQL database:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
6. Create the database:

Go to the following URL (adminer): http://localhost:8081/

It will allow you to create the database from a GUI interface.

Like so :

Click on the Create database button, you will name the database `rioc` and click on the register button.

Like so :

If you want to use your own MySQL database, you will have to create the database manually.
For example, you can use the following command:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Then, you will have to create the database:

```sq
CREATE DATABASE rioc;
```

7. Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or with your IDE go to the `RiocApplication.java` file and run it.

Like so :

![img_2.png](img_2.png)

8. Go to the following URL: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

You will see the Swagger UI:
